									<h3>Machine Learning Engineer<br />
										(Oct 2023 - Nov 2024 )
										<br /></h3>
									<h4>Co-lab Research Lab</h4>
									
									<p>The Co-Lab Research Lab at FAST-NUCES provides a dynamic and collaborative environment that fosters innovation and creativity in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. During my time there, I worked on several advanced machine learning projects, with a primary focus on developing and fine-tuning large language models. These included prominent models such as LLaMA, Falcon, and Biomistral, which I enhanced using various state-of-the-art techniques.

										One of my key responsibilities was implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to improve the performance and accuracy of these models. By leveraging this technique and applying extensive fine-tuning, I successfully increased model accuracy to an impressive range of 88% to 94%. This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise in machine learning frameworks, explore cutting-edge research methodologies, and contribute meaningfully to the field of generative AI.</p>

									Web Developer<br />
										(Mar 2022 - May 2023 )
										<br /></h3>
									<h4>Google Developer Student Clubs</h4>
									
									<p>As a member of the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), I worked as a Web Developer, where I specialized in building dynamic and responsive web applications using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This role allowed me to develop end-to-end solutions, from designing intuitive user interfaces to implementing robust backend systems, while adhering to industry best practices. Additionally, I collaborated with a diverse team of developers, enhancing my problem-solving skills and gaining hands-on experience in creating scalable and efficient web solutions.</p>

										Python Developer<br />
										(Nov 2020 - Nov 2023 )
										<br /></h3>
									<h4>Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador </h4>
									
									<p>As a Python Developer in the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program, I worked on diverse and impactful projects that highlighted my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and web development. I extracted and aggregated data from various sources, including databases and web platforms, using tools like Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Scrapy to streamline data collection and processing. Additionally, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis with Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, uncovering actionable insights. Leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, I designed, developed, and trained machine learning models for advanced predictive analytics and informed decision-making. To enhance user interaction, I created a user-friendly web interface with Django, enabling seamless integration with machine learning models and dynamic data visualizations.</p>
