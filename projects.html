												This project focuses on developing an innovative computer program designed to revolu-
											tionize the learning of human anatomy. This program integrates advanced features such
											as an AI-powered chatbot, AI-driven quizzes, and immersive 3D anatomy visualization
											tools. The motivation behind this initiative arises from the common challenges students
											face in mastering extensive anatomy content within limited timeframes, often leading to
											gaps in understanding and retention.
											  <span class="full-story">
												To address these issues, we aimed to create a dy-
										namic, interactive educational tool that enhances learning outcomes. We began by review-
										ing relevant research to identify key areas where students struggle and to explore potential
										technological solutions. A meticulously prepared dataset, sourced from "Snell’s Clinical
										Anatomy," provided the foundational information needed to train our system. Leverag-
										ing natural language processing (NLP), we developed a chatbot using the BioMistral 7B
										model, chosen for its expertise in handling medical terminology and concepts. This chat-
										bot was rigorously trained and fine-tuned to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate
										responses to a wide range of anatomy-related queries. The chatbot’s performance was
										evaluated using an evaluation matrix focusing on faithfulness and relevancy. The chat-
										bot achieved a faithfulness score of 0.83 and a relevancy score of 0.87, validating its
										effectiveness in providing accurate and pertinent information. In addition to the chatbot,
										the program features AI-driven quizzes that reinforce learning by adapting to the user’s
										progress and identifying areas for improvement. The 3D anatomy visualization tool en-
										hances the learning experience by offering an interactive exploration of human organs and
										systems, catering to different learning styles. By combining textual, visual, and interac-
										tive elements, our program provides a comprehensive and engaging approach to anatomy
										education.</br>

										<p>
											This project involved developing a robust system to classify cyber-attacks within network traffic by analyzing various network attributes. The system was designed to detect and categorize malicious activities, contributing to improved network security. To achieve this, multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
										  <span class="full-story">
											The classification system was rigorously evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of network traffic attributes. Each algorithm's performance was assessed in terms of accuracy, achieving an impressive range of 92% to 95% on average. These results highlight the system's effectiveness in accurately identifying cyber-attacks, making it a valuable tool for real-time threat detection and mitigation in network environments.
										

                                             This project demonstrates proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, and cybersecurity, offering a scalable solution to bolster network defense mechanisms.
